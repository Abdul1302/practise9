12-point type, use 12/72nd or 1/6th of an inch. Or,
 you can use your eye to adjust the paragraph indent 
to suit your tastes. I often let mine vary from a 
digital “em,” because every typeface has characters 
of different widths and proportions, even at the same 
point size. As always, when in doubt, defer to a trained
eye. If stranded on a desert island, use a hair shy of 1/8-inch.
